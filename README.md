# 🎯 SpotLight – A React Native Fullstack Social Sharing Platform

SpotLight is a **React Native fullstack social sharing platform** I built to deepen my understanding of mobile development and backend integration.

While this project was inspired by a React Native tutorial, I decided to **reimagine the entire backend from scratch** to gain hands-on experience designing a real-world system end to end.

## ✨ Features

📱 **Mobile App:** Built with React Native

🗄️ **Custom Backend:**

- User authentication & authorization
- RESTful API routes
- Database migrations and schema design

⚡ **State Management:** Implemented with Zustand

🔒 **Secure Authentication:** Replaced Clerk with my own auth logic

🧩 **Convex Replaced:** Fully custom backend logic instead of Convex

🛠️ **Full CRUD Operations** for posts and user profiles

## 🎯 Why I Built This

I didn’t want this to be *just another tutorial project*.  
Instead, I used the tutorial as a **launchpad to build everything backend-related myself**, including:

- Designing the database
- Writing all APIs
- Handling authentication
- Structuring state management

This helped me bridge the gap between **theory and practical, production-ready development**.

## 📂 Note on Folder Structure

The backend folder structure is intentionally simple and not heavily modularized. My main focus was to **practice React Native frontend integration**, rather than polishing backend architecture in this project.
